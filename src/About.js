        <div className='textAbout'>
            I am a French engineering student currently living in Paris and looking for internships.
            Passionate about informatics for several years now, I am currently trying to get skills and experience in web development and machine learning.

            <div className='textAbout'>
            When I am not coding, I spend a lot of time in cinemas and museums (a bit less in 2020 ...). The classic Parisian arty boy, I know. 
            I am also trying to find time (and money) to travel as much as possible, I am really fond of nature and vast open spaces. I would love to get some professional experience abroad to improve my English and step out of my comfort zone.
